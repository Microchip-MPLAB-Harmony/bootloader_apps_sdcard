|test\_app/firmware/pic32mz\_das\_sk.X|MPLABX Project for [PIC32MZ Embedded Graphics with Stacked DRAM \(DA\) Starter Kit \(Crypto\)](http://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/DM320010-C)|

## Setting up [PIC32MZ Embedded Graphics with Stacked DRAM \(DA\) Starter Kit \(Crypto\)](http://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/DM320010-C)

-   Connect a micro USB cable to the UART-USB port J5

-   For programming, connect a micro USB cable to the USB Debug port J19

-   Use the micro sdcard slot J10 of the device to insert a micro sdcard


## Running the Application

1.  Open the test application project *test\_app/firmware/pic32mz\_das\_sk.X* in the IDE

2.  Build the project to generate the binary **\(Do not program the binary\)**

3.  Open the bootloader project *bootloader/firmware/pic32mz\_das\_sk.X* in the IDE

4.  Build and program the application using the IDE

5.  **LED1** will be Turned On once programming is completed and bootloader starts running

6.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera Term\) on the computer to get test application messages through UART once bootloaded

7.  Configure the serial port settings as follows:

    -   Baud : 115200

    -   Data : 8 Bits

    -   Parity : None

    -   Stop : 1 Bit

    -   Flow Control : None

8.  Copy the generated application binary file to a micro sdcard from the Host PC

    -   *<harmony3\_path\>/bootloader\_apps\_sdcard/apps/sdcard\_bootloader/test\_app/firmware/pic32mz\_das\_sk.X/dist/pic32mz\_das\_sk/production/pic32mz\_das\_sk.X.production.bin*

9.  Rename the copied application binary file to **image.bin**

10. Insert the micro sdcard with the application binary **image.bin** to the micro sdcard slot on the device

11. Once the application is successfully programmed **LED3** should start blinking and you should see below output on the console

    ![output](GUID-3069D8A1-7C9E-483C-8ACD-2CB83302DE3D-low.png)

12. Remove the micro sdcard from the sdcard slot

13. Press and hold the Switch **SW1** to trigger Bootloader from test application and you should see below output

    ![output](GUID-1E0923BA-91D0-40D1-B646-6C1172C12DF1-low.png)

14. Repeat Steps 10-12 once and jump to Step-15

    -   This step is to verify that bootloader is running after triggering bootloader from test application in Step 13

15. **Press and hold** the Switch **SW1** and then press Reset button or Power cycle the device to force trigger bootloader at startup

16. Repeat Steps 10-12 once

    -   This step is to verify whether bootloader is triggered by switch press at reset


## Additional Steps \(Optional\)

-   To bootload any other application refer to [Application Configurations](GUID-E3D8AF7A-EF89-4335-A7BF-7B1F93A2FEDD.md)

-   Once done repeat the applicable steps mentioned in [Running The Application](#running-the-application)
